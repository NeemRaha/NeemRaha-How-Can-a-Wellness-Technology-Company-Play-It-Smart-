Business Task:
Examine FitBit fitness tracker data to see how users interact with the FitBit app and identify trends for Bellabeat’s marketing plan.

Ask Phase:
We must first ask ourselves: Who are our main stakeholders? We have the following stakeholders in this situation:

Urška Sršen: Bellabeat’s co-founder and Chief Creative Officer
Sando Mur: Mathematician and Bellabeat’s co-founder; key member of the Bellabeat executive team.

The Bellabeat analytics team for marketing: a group of data analysts whose job is is to gather, examine, and report data that aids in determining Bellabeat’s marketing plan.

Business Objectives:
What are some trends in smart device usage?
How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?


Prepare Phase:
Sršen encouraged me to use openly available data that examines the daily routines of smart device users. She directs me to the following data set:

Data from the FitBit fitness tracker (CC0: Public Domain; made public through Mobius): Thirty Fitbit customers’ personal fitness trackers are included in this Kaggle data collection. Thirty eligible Fitbit users agreed to submit their personal tracker data, which included minute-level output for heart rate, sleep, and physical activity monitoring. It contains data on daily activity, steps, and heart rate that may be examined to learn more about users’ routines. 18 csv files containing data from the FitBit fitness tracker are freely accessible on Kaggle.

We identify the data being used and its constraints during the Prepare step.

Data was gathered in 2016 seven years ago. Since then, users’ routines for everyday activity, eating, exercising, and sleeping may have changed. Data might not be current or pertinent.
A sample size of 30 FitBit users does not accurately represent the fitness market as a whole.
We cannot guarantee the integrity or correctness of the data because it is acquired through a survey.

Analyze Phase:
Findings:
Daily Activity Dataset:

The average distance traveled is 5.490 km, which is less than the necessary 8 km mark, and the average number of steps taken is 7638, which is less than the needed 10000 steps.
The average amount of time spent sedentary is 991.2 minutes, or 16.52 hours, which is much more than the recommended maximum of 7 hours.
The average calories the average user consumes daily are 2304 kCal.
The aim of 30 minutes per day is not met by the average of highly active minutes, which is 21.16 minutes.
Sleep Per Day Dataset:

The average user sleeps for a total of 419 minutes, or around 7 hours.
The typical night in bed lasts 458 minutes (or 7 hours 30 min).
Based on the above two statements, this suggests that the average user is awake in bed for roughly 30 minutes.
Weight Log Info Dataset:

We cannot assess a person’s health only based on their weight; other variables, such as height and body fat percentage, have an impact on health.
The average user’s average body fat percentage is 23.5%.
The healthy BMI range is between 18 to 24.9, however the average BMI is 25.19, which is significantly higher.
The average user’s average weight is 72 kg, or 158.8 pounds.

ACT Phase:
The last step is where I give my observations and make suggestions based on my analysis. I’ll go back to the business questions to do that.

What are some trends in smart device usage?

According to our analysis, the majority of people use applications to monitor their activity levels and calories burned; fewer people use them to monitor their sleep, and very few people use them to monitor their weight. Therefore, I advise putting more of an emphasis on step, calorie, and sleep tracking in the application.
The average sitting time for users is 16 hours per day.
The typical daily step count is 7638. This is less steps than the adult recommendation of 10,000.
A user’s average sleep duration is 419 minutes, or roughly 7 hours. Additionally, an average night in bed lasts 458 minutes (or 7 hours 30 min). The aforementioned two statements imply that the typical user spends about 30 minutes awake in bed.
How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?

We have a very detailed information, especially from female users. Fitbit, on the other hand, offers products that enable customers to better understand their sleep, activity, and general health habits and give them access to this information to encourage healthy practices. The insights are applicable because Bellabeat’s user base shares these characteristics.
The majority of users (62.5%) of fitness trackers are obese. Therefore, there is a chance to persuade people to lead better lives.
How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

Positive correlation is seen in the relationships between steps taken and calories burned as well as between very active minutes and calories burned. So, this may be a successful marketing tactic.
Bellabeat can periodically remind users about their sedentary behavior on the application or on the tracker itself. Since the majority of FitBit app users, 81.3%, are not using it to track their health habits, this information might be quite useful for marketing strategy.
The Bellabeat marketing team can motivate customers by informing and empowering them with knowledge on the advantages of fitness, suggesting various workouts, and providing information on calorie intake and burn rate via the Bellabeat application.
