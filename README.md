Business Task:
Examine FitBit fitness tracker data to see how users interact with the FitBit app and identify trends for Bellabeat’s marketing plan.

My observations and make suggestions based on my analysis. I’ll go back to the business questions to do that.

What are some trends in smart device usage?

According to our analysis, the majority of people use applications to monitor their activity levels and calories burned; fewer people use them to monitor their sleep, and very few people use them to monitor their weight. Therefore, I advise putting more of an emphasis on step, calorie, and sleep tracking in the application.
The average sitting time for users is 16 hours per day.
The typical daily step count is 7638. This is less steps than the adult recommendation of 10,000.
A user’s average sleep duration is 419 minutes, or roughly 7 hours. Additionally, an average night in bed lasts 458 minutes (or 7 hours 30 min). The aforementioned two statements imply that the typical user spends about 30 minutes awake in bed.
How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?

We have a very detailed information, especially from female users. Fitbit, on the other hand, offers products that enable customers to better understand their sleep, activity, and general health habits and give them access to this information to encourage healthy practices. The insights are applicable because Bellabeat’s user base shares these characteristics.
The majority of users (62.5%) of fitness trackers are obese. Therefore, there is a chance to persuade people to lead better lives.
How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

Positive correlation is seen in the relationships between steps taken and calories burned as well as between very active minutes and calories burned. So, this may be a successful marketing tactic.
Bellabeat can periodically remind users about their sedentary behavior on the application or on the tracker itself. Since the majority of FitBit app users, 81.3%, are not using it to track their health habits, this information might be quite useful for marketing strategy.
The Bellabeat marketing team can motivate customers by informing and empowering them with knowledge on the advantages of fitness, suggesting various workouts, and providing information on calorie intake and burn rate via the Bellabeat application.
